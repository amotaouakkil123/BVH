Hi!

You've stumbled upon my beginner graphics project as an introduction to OpenGL for COMP 557 at McGill
and as well as the math underlying the discipline.
The task was to load a bvh file, draw all the axes at the right spot and then finally implement
the draw method DAGNode to recursively draw the animation.
The source code and resources are provided and only a short video is necessary to view the project
as building the entire project would require more effort on your part.

Thank you and enjoy!

Here is the video to my project: https://youtu.be/iadYdE0adFg
