Hi!

You've stumbled upon my beginner graphics project as an introduction to OpenGL for COMP 557 at McGill
and as well as the math underlying the discipline.
The src folder contains all the source files used to code the project while the resources directory
contains all the shaders and bvh files that are loaded in the project.
The task was to load a bvh file, draw all the axes at the right spot and then finally implement
the draw method DAGNode to recursively draw the animation. Using a MatrixStack.
The source code and resources are provided and only a short video is necessary to view the project
as building the entire project would require more effort on your part.

I learned a lot about 3D transformations as well as the basics of OpenGL and the graphics pipeline.
I am also a lot more comfortable with implementing OOP with OpenGL.

Thank you and enjoy!

Here is the video to my project: https://youtu.be/iadYdE0adFg
